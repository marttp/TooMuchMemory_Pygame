# TooMuchMemory_Pygame
Mini project for Computer Software Laboratory (CPE RMUTT)

Hello everyone.
I made this game for Mini project.

Game concept is play by kid around grade 1-6.

This game will train your brain so much because squares random its color everytime when you start a new game.

I didn't make a execute file. If you want to play this game , You can open "Main.py" with Python.

Thank you for your attention.
